<p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">FlaskCon is a diverse community who maintains a reputation as a friendly, welcoming, inspiring and dynamic group. Weâ€™d like to keep it that way, which is why we ask all participants, speakers, organizers and sponsors (collectively: the attendees) to follow the same code of conduct (CoC) as upheld by <a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/coc/">EuroPython 2020</a>.</p>
